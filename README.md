# EduSync

EduSync is an educational management app that aims to simplify classroom activities and improve communication between teachers and students. Drawing from concepts in *The Pragmatic Programmer*, the app focuses on keeping things simple, adaptable, and easy to maintain. Key features include:

- **Timetable with Notifications**: Automatic reminders for students based on their class schedules.
- **Attendance Tracking**: A straightforward way for teachers to record and monitor attendance.
- **Events List**: A section where teachers can post upcoming school or class events for students to see.
- **Updates (Chat Feature)**: A messaging system inspired by WhatsApp, where only teachers can send important updates to the class.

Built with *The Pragmatic Programmer* principles in mind, EduSync focuses on practicality and flexibility in development.
